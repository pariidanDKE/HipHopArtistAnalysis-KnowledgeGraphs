# HipHopArtistAnalysis-KnowledgeGraphs

For information on methodology, and analysis of results, please view the report for this course proejct in the repository :** BMKG_Project Report(i6254321)**

#### Details on struct and running it 

The implementation of the graph and its testing is done across 5 jupyter notebooks.

The details on the content of each notebook can be found in the report (and also in their titles and contents of course).

The order in which they are created/ should be executed if required:

1. DataPreprocessing (make sure you have all needed data in directory 'Data')
2. PublicImageAnalysis(*)
3. GraphConsutruction
4. GraphQualityAssesment
5. QueryGraph


* NOTE: For the execution of requests in the notebook PublicImageAnalyisis, an HF_Token is required to interact with the used LLM. This token is obtained by creating an account on HuggingFace, the token should be copied from the site and put into the root folder, as  .hf_token (the one I used not added to the project for privacy reasons).*
